Group numbers by their remainder (mod 13) to maximize the wins you could get from a pair. Hint: try to find pairs whose remainder opens up two wins, not just one.

[this brute force attempt](q1_brute_force.py) will never output a solution because the solution space is so large. You might be able to compute this using google OR tools ([their SAT-Solver](https://developers.google.com/optimization/cp/cp_solver)).
